**After two years of not having a race, we finally came back to the Albert Park street circuit for the 2022 Australian GP.**

With record attendance for any Australian sporting event, and the ongoing fight between Redbull and Ferrari, the scene was set for an exciting race, and I am not sure we got what a lot of us were expecting. Don't get me wrong, it was a good race. However, Charles Leclerc's pace meant none of the Redbulls were able to challenge. The only fight we had for the lead was when Charles overestimated the amount of grip on his cold tyres coming out of the final corner at the Safety Car restart, so Max was able to get a run on him but it was not enough to get past the Ferrari

## Is Redbull in trouble?

Max Verstappen suffered another DNF when his engine caught fire on the final laps of the Grand Prix, when he was running P2. This means he has so far completed only 1 race of the 3 he has entered, which puts him 6th on the constructor championship. This, coupled with the double DNF for Redbull at the opening round at Bahrein, raises a very important question. Are Redbull really able to challenge for a title with an unreliable car?

The short answer is no, let me elaborate. Right now, Redbull have had the 2nd fastest car, really close to the Ferrari's ultimate pace, and yet they sit 3rd in the constructors championship behind last year's main title rivals Mercedes, despite them having the 3rd, 4th or even 5th fastest car at times. I don't see Redbull or Max Verstappen being able to defend the World Championship this year until they sort out their reliability issues.
